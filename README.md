Thanks a lot [JOHN OTANDER](http://johnotander.com) for his Jekyll theme adapted here!  
  
Please remove all files from /pages/ dir as well as the personal data from _config.yaml if you intent to reuse it online. Even better: GET THE ORIGINAL from [https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll). Thank you!
